I also used Python to create data visualizations to explore the data and to communicate my findings.
My analysis revealed that the key factors that affect the price of a house include:
I used different factors to build a predictive model to estimate the price of a house. 

I encourage you to check out the project and let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
